Hello! I'm Duke
I am currently able to help you keep track of tasks
scheduled to receive a personality soon, exciting!
Type "help" to find out what I can do for you.
========================================================================
I currently support 3 types of tasks: todo, deadline and event
To add a todo task: todo (task name)
To add a deadline task: deadline (task name) /by (date or time)
To add an event task: event (task name) /at (date or time)
To delete a task in the list: delete (x) where x is the entry number
note that only the words in parentheses() can be replaced
To see your current list, Use the command "list"
To cross out an entry, use the command "done x" where x is the entry number
To save your current data, use the command "save"
To clear all your saved data, use the command "clearsave"
When you're done, type "bye" to end the program (automatically saves your current list)
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[T][ ] task 1
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[D][ ] task 2 (by: tomorrow)
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[E][ ] task 3 (at: thursday 1pm)
========================================================================
Here is your current list
1.[T][ ] task 1
2.[D][ ] task 2 (by: tomorrow)
3.[E][ ] task 3 (at: thursday 1pm)
You have 3 task(s) on your list.
========================================================================
task 1 done. Well done.
========================================================================
task 2 done. Well done.
========================================================================
task 3 done. Well done.
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[T][X] task 1
========================================================================
the done command is of the form "done x" where x is an entry number
========================================================================
That entry number does not exist in your list
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[D][X] task 2 (by: tomorrow)
========================================================================
I've deleted the following entry
[E][X] task 3 (at: thursday 1pm)
========================================================================
Bye! See you soon!
