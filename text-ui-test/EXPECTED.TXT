Hello! I'm Duke
I am currently able to help you keep track of tasks
scheduled to receive a personality soon, exciting!
Type "help" to find out what I can do for you.
========================================================================
I currently support 3 types of tasks: todo, deadline and event
To add a todo task: todo (task name)
To add a deadline task: deadline (task name) /by (date or time)
To add an event task: event (task name) /at (date or time)
To delete a task in the list: delete (x) where x is the entry number
note that only the words in parentheses() can be replaced
Use the command "list" and I will show you your current list
To cross out an entry, use the command "done x" where x is the entry number
When you're done, type "bye" to end the program
========================================================================
I've added the following task:
[T][ ] task 1
