Type "help" to find out what I can do for you.
===============================================================================
I currently support 3 types of tasks: todo, deadline and event
To add a todo task: todo (task name)
To add a deadline task: deadline (task name) /by (date or time)
To add an event task: event (task name) /at (date or time)
